##About the project

Project Title: RFID-Enabled Fare Incentivization with Smart Contracts

**Overview:**

The RFID-Enabled Fare Incentivization project combines cutting-edge technology with blockchain innovation to revolutionize fare payment systems. Leveraging Solidity-based smart contracts and RFID technology, this project aims to incentivize users to utilize RFID cards for fare payment in a seamless, efficient, and rewarding manner.


*Key Components:*
1. Solidity Smart Contract - Developed as an ERC20 contract, it incorporates specialized functions designed to interact with RFID technology. This smart contract is initially deployed on the ArbitrumSepolia, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.

2. RFID Integration -  The heart of the project lies in its integration of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Each user is provided with an RFID card containing a unique identifier.

3. STM32 Microcontroller: The RFID reading system is powered by an STM32 Microcontroller. This high-performance microcontroller efficiently processes RFID data, enabling seamless communication between RFID cards and the smart contract.

*Functionality:*
1. Fare Payment - Users can conveniently pay for fares by tapping their RFID cards on designated readers. The STM32 Microcontroller captures the RFID data and initiates a transaction through the Solidity smart contract.
